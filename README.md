This is the source code for "firebot", the IRC bot who hangs out in channels on
irc.mozilla.org.

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

firebot is in "maintenance mode", which means development is primarily focused
on bug fixes.

I recommend Sopel (http://sopel.chat/) for new irc bot projects.
